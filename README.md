# BookMarked (Server-side)

BookMarked is a web application that allows users access to a virtual 'library' where they can add books that they have read or are interested in reading. They can also review these books.

## About the User
BookMarked is an application that allows users to keep track of books that they have read, are currently reading, or would like to read. It also allows users to review books that they have in their library. Users can follow one another, and see on their homepage feed when another user reviews a book.

## Features
- BookMarked uses Google authentication to log in, and then allows users to create a BookMarked account that is accessed with their Google account.
- Users can update their account/profile information.
- Users can add (create) books to their library.  If needed, they can edit (update) the book’s information, or delete the book altogether. When they look (read) at their library page, they will see all of the books that they have added.
- Books will have 4 statuses: Read, Currently Reading, Want to Read, or Did Not Finish. Users can update these statuses on their books.
- Users can review the books that they have in their library.
- Users can view their own profile or another user’s profile. On the user's profile, they will see a list of books that they have marked as 'favorites.' On other users’ profiles, they will see any reviews that user has posted.
- Users can follow one another.  Users’ home pages will display a feed of reviews left by users they follow.
